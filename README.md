# 🌍 Bestrust Servers Translations

Welcome to the **Bestrust Servers community translation project!** We want our servers to be accessible to everyone, regardless of what language they speak. 

If you see a typo or a bad translation, you can fix it right here from your browser. You don't need to download anything or know how to code.

## 🛠 How to Contribute (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have one, [sign up for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). You need this to save your changes.

### 2. Find your Language
* Click on the folder for your language (e.g., `es-ES` for Spanish, `fr` for French).
* Click on the `.json` file inside that folder (e.g., `RustCore.json`).

### 3. Edit the File
* In the top right corner of the file view, click the **Pencil Icon** (Edit this file).
* GitHub will tell you that it's creating a "fork" of the project for you. This is normal! It just means you are making your own copy to work on.

### 4. Make your Changes
The files look like this:

"Kits.Title": "Kit Menu",
"Kits.Claimed": "You have claimed your kit!"

* **ONLY** change the text on the **right side** of the colon (`:`).
* **DO NOT** change the words on the left (e.g., `"Kits.Title"`).
* **DO NOT** delete the quotation marks (`" "`) or the commas (`,`).

### 5. Submit your Translation
* Once you are finished, scroll down to the **Commit changes** box.
* Give your change a short title (e.g., *"Fixed Spanish typo in Kits"*).
* Click the green **"Propose changes"** or **"Commit changes"** button.
* On the next screen, click the green **"Create pull request"** button.

## 📜 Rules & Tips
* **Be Professional:** Do not add insults, jokes, or advertisements.
* **Stay in the Lines:** Ensure you don't break the JSON structure (watch those curly brackets `{ }` and commas `,`).
* **Wait for Review:** An admin will check your translation. Once approved, it will be merged and automatically updated on all Bestrust servers!

**Thank you for helping the community!** ❤️
